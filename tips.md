#埃及之战小贴士

开局： 1.派具备机动天赋的英雄带 T1 骑兵首占要塞。推荐：兰斯洛特、龙骑士、曹操。 2.等传送到方尖碑再派兵出去挖矿，直到战斗结束都要不停的采集。 3.上下路骑兵集结对面方尖碑，如果侦查显示守军比我强，在抵达我方要塞时，集结手解散集结队伍，解散的部队可以占领或驻守附近建筑。

上下路： 1.上下路尽量避免不必要的野战，以集结要塞、生命泉、神庙为主。用二线英雄满编进集结，至少 T3。（野战获得积分最少） 2.上下路允许的情况下，可派兵到中路帮忙抢棺柩。 3.派部队驻守方尖碑、要塞和生命泉，尽量用步兵和孙武。 4.抢占对方方尖碑后，速度迁城过去，集结对方城堡（城堡起火一段时间会自动飞回初始地）

中路： 1.唯一任务抢棺柩。每人出两队抢棺柩，一队步兵一队骑兵。打架时步兵在前，骑兵在后。 2.中路依情况，看上下路哪一边人少，迁城过去。（多余队伍可采集）

Osiris Tips

At the beginning：

1. Send a hero with a mobility talent and T1 cavalry to occupy the Altar first, and then back War Camp immediately after the first occupation. Recommended: Lancelot, Dragon Lancer, Cao Cao.
2. Send troops to gather Caravan after TP to the Obelisk, keeping gather until the end of the battle.
3. Use cavalry to rally Enemy Obelisk. If the scout shows that the enemy's defender is stronger than us, upon reaching our Altar, Rally Commander disbands the rallying team. The disbanded troops can occupy or station nearby buildings.

Top&Bottom Lane：

1. Try to avoid unnecessary field battles, focusing on rallying building. Use the second strongest heroes to fill the rally, at least T3. (The field gets the least points)
2. If allowed, send troops to the middle road to help grab the Ark.
3. Send troops stationed in our Obelisk, Shrine of Life, and Altar; in addition, the infantry and Sun Wu should be used as far as possible.
   4.After occupying the enemy's Obelisk, quickly TP city to there and rally the enemy's War Camp (the War Camp will automatically fly back to the initial place after a period of fire)

Middle Lane:

1. The only task is to grab the Ark. Each member sent two troops, one team of infantry and one team of cavalry. The infantry is at the front during the fight and the cavalry is at the rear
2. Depending on the situation of the middle lane, see which lane needs help and tp city to top or bottom lane. (Excess teams can do gathering)
